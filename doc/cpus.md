# CPUs

Some CPUs are included in JTFRAME. Some of them can be found in other repositories in Github but the versions in JTFRAME include clock enable inputs and other improvements.

Many CPUs have convenient wrappers that add cycle recovery functionality, or
that allow the selection between different modules for the same CPU.

CPU selection is done via verilog [macros](macros.md).
