# JTFRAME target for DE10-Standard (MiSTer) Platform

DE10-Standard target by @somhi 

### Target information

DE10-Standard board has many similarities with the DE10-nano board (includes the same FPGA) and therefore it is compatible with the MiSTer platform. The same applies to the DE1-SoC  and SoCkit boards all from Terasic.

The DE10-Standard target leverages all built-in hardware capabilities of the board:

- VGA 24 bit analog video output
- Audio CODEC with line-in, line-out, and mic input

Main difference with the DE10-nano is that it does not include an HDMI video output. 

More information about how to use the DE10-Standard board as a MiSTer compatible platform can be found at https://github.com/sockitfpga/MiSTer_SoCkit.
